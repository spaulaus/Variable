# Variable 
In physics, a variable is an object that has three components : a value, an error, and units. We need to be able to 
handle all of these things when we perform calculations. When we multiply, add, subtract, or divide physical 
quantities that have error bars, the error must be propagated properly. In addition, when we add or subtract physical
 quantities we must make sure that these all have the same units.
